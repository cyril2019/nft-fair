## ⭐ Introduction

Hello world 👋 ,

Really proud to present before you, ***NFT-Fair*** , a place to forget about the complexities of NFTs and just play around with them. Create, buy, sell, earn and even play with the NFTs. This is the one true stop shop for NFTs.  Applause for the awesome people at ***thirdweb***, whose product made this project possible.



## 💫 NFT-Fair is so cool, but what is the need for it ?

You must have seen plenty of articles filled with esoteric jargon (thanks for this phrase hashnode team), dedicated websites and even videos explaining what are these NFTs and how can I get one? But there should be a place where you can just go in and get your hands dirty, mint some NFTs, buy or sell your work of art and even play with them. 

Simply said, this is just a playground for you to interact with NFTs on a test network (Rinkeby).

## ✨ What did we use to build it!

- **React Framework - NextJs**
- **Everything Web3 - Thirdweb**
- **UI Components - Chakra UI**
- **CSS Framework - Tailwind CSS**
- **Deployment - Heroku**

## 🚓 Code quality 

We have used **ESLint** and **prettier** to maintain the consistency of the code and follow best practices. The website is completely responsive thus upholding the untold rules of UI/UX.

## 🔥 Thirdweb

Thanks to the people at Thirdweb for their awesome product and constantly helping us, responding to our doubts, throughout the journey of making this app. We were able to utilise a total of 3 modules : Collection, Marketplace and Bundle, and we were totally amazed by the ease at which we were able to do complex stuff such as creating listings, selling NFTs etc.

## 💭 Plans for the future

To make our project even more awesome, we have planned a few features :

- Right now, we only have 1 game that the user can play with their NFT. We plan to add more variety of games to our app.
- We are awarding only 1 premium NFT based on the performance in our games. Adding more premium NFTs based on different performances is something we are planning to do.
- Adding more support to Pixel art maker and also giving the functionality to add images as files which can be minted.
